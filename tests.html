              <h3 style="float: left;color: brown;">1. Scrum Foundation Professional Certificate (SFPC) </h3>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">This test was organised by CertiProf professional knowledge. I have given the test on 24/07/2020.To pass this test, I have studied "The Scrum Guide" provided in pdf format of with some little research on google.
                Some points to be noted from this test are:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">
                Scrum is- </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">
                  <ol> 1. Lightweight</ol>
                  <ol>2. Simple to understand</ol>
                  <ol>3. Difficult to master</ol>
                  <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">
                From the Scrum theory- </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">
                Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
                * Last but not least, The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. The thing I understood from Scrum Master is "The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team".
                Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules,
                and values.</p>
              <h3 style="float: left;color: brown;">2. Remote Work and Virtual Collaboration - (English) RWVCPC </h3>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">This test was organized by CertiProf at no cost, which becomes a golden opportunity for me to enhance my skills in the topic "Remote Work and Virtual Collaboration". Few important things I noted from the test are: * Remote working is an experience of doing traditional office work outside. It requires effective time management skills and organized work practice even more than in the regular office hours inside the office. * The acronym VUCA was created by the US army war college to describe the world situation that has emerged after the end of the cold war and like the one generated by covid-19 means Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. * Working more independently than as a team member may lose the manager's (head) trust. * Telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to perform work, during any part of regular, paid hours, at an approved alternative worksite (e.g., home, telework center).</p>

              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p style="text-align: center;color: darkblue;">I have earned my first skill assessment test on 08/05/2021 in Agile Methodologies. As I am intrested in psychology and its related topics, so Agile Mindset and its significance attracted me when I did my first time course in coursera about Agile Development, and then as my interest increases, I have given test in CertiProf, which was available for free. I am thankful to linkedin for offering these kind of quizes which enhances skills of students like me.  </p>
