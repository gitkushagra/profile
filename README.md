# Myweb
 Note: This project is fully developed and deployed.
This is my personal portfolio, that I have created to accumulate all my doings at one place.
I have taken a pre-made sample that was available for free, than modified it for my needs by myself. 
It uses latest HTML with CSS and JavaScript.
I have used Microsoft Visual Studio Code for editing the code locally in my windows laptop.
Than uploaded it to GitHub for hosting purpose. 
I have also used a custom domain from namecheap as http://kushagrame.work. 
However, URL provided by GitHub is always available to use.
I have learnt many skills like bug fixing, modification of code and various on the go troubleshooting.
