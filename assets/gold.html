    <h3>Crack leaked password database at Goldman Sachs by Forage</h3>
    <p>Respected Sir/Ma’am,</p>
    <p>I am Kushagra Singh, participated in an internship “Crack Leaked Password database” and engaged in all resources available.</p>
    <p>I have found the following:</p>
    <p><ol>1. MD5 (Message Digest algorithm 5) is weak and insecure. It can be easily cracked by hackers; hence, it is recommended to use latest hashing techniques like SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) to minimise the risk.</ol>
    <ol>2. From the “Anatomy of a hack” as provided in resource, it is very clear that a weak password is a piece of cake for hackers and crackers and if MD5 is used is a boon. It describes how various techniques like brute-force attack can be used to hack such passwords using premade combinations of passwords.</ol>
    <ol>3. A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password  or passphrase Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. It is used in SHA-256.</ol>
    <ol>4. A hash function is used to generate a unique hash code for each combination of characters in alpha-numeric form. It is used to secure potential data and information, for example, in blockchain.</ol>
    <ol>5. Password cracking tools are used to recover the password of the encrypted file or system.</ol>
    <ol>6. Password Strength checker can be used to check the password strength, how strong or weak is the password.</ol>
    </p>
    <p>From the password dump file as provided, after trying to crack and recover the passwords, following conclusions are made:
    </p>
    <p><ol>1.	The password policy used is not up to the mark. The passwords used are too weak.</ol>
        <ol>2.	MD5 algorithm makes the storage of passwords even worse, and were easily cracked using cracking tools in kali-linux like hashcat or online hash decrypt tools. </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Following Measures can be taken to make strong passwords and password storage:</p>
    <p><ol>1.	The password length should be of minimum 6 to 8 characters long.</ol>
        <ol>2.	Passwords should be alphanumeric in nature i.e., at least one combination of alphabet and a numeric.</ol>
        <ol>3.	The password should contain at least one special character like $, @, # etc.</ol>
        <ol>4.	Password re-use should be avoided.</ol>
        <ol>5.	Do not use any personal information like name, parent’s name, date of birth etc., in passwords.</ol>
        <ol>6.	Use latest hashing algorithms to store passwords, which uses latest and updated security measures.</ol>
    </p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
